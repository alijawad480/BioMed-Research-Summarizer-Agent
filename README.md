# BioMed-Research-Summarizer-Agent
Summarization of Research Papers

Upload a biomedical research paper in PDF format and instantly generate a concise summary.
This feature saves time by extracting the most important insights from lengthy academic documents.

 Use Case: Quickly understanding the core contributions of a 20+ page research paper.

 Search Paper by Title (Semantic Scholar)

Search biomedical papers by title or keywords using Semantic Scholar API.
Select from results, view details, and summarize either the abstract or full paper PDF if available.

 Use Case: Discover and summarize relevant papers for your research without manual searching.

 Question Answering (Q&A)

Ask specific questions from a given research paper’s abstract, methods, or results section.
The AI model extracts precise answers and provides a confidence score.

 Use Case: "What methodology was used for cancer detection?" or "Which dataset was applied in the study?"

 Trend Analysis of Abstracts

Paste multiple abstracts to find top keywords and research trends.
The system shows keyword frequency counts and visualizes trends in a clear plot.

 Use Case: Identify trending topics in biomedical research, such as AI in drug discovery or genomics.

 Novelty Detection

Compare a target abstract with multiple related abstracts to measure novelty.
The tool computes a novelty score (0-1) and highlights the most unique sentences.

Use Case: Check if your research idea is novel compared to existing studies.

Summary

The BioMed Research Summarizer Agent combines summarization, search, Q&A, trend analysis, and novelty detection in a single tool — making biomedical literature analysis faster, smarter, and more efficient.
